Your job is to generate synthetic examples for entity linking, mimicking the language style found in PubMed abstracts.

# Input Format
- **CUI**:
A unique concept ID
- **Definitions**:
One or more definitions of the concept
- **Mentions**:
A list of mentions (may include technical or unnatural terms)

# Tasks
Perform these tasks:
1. **Mention Selection & Generation:**
   - First evaluate which existing mentions sound most natural in professional biomedical writing (clinical or research contexts)
   - Keep only the most fluent mentions from the existing list
   - Then generate additional high-quality mentions that:
     * Add natural variations researchers would use
     * Cover different naming conventions (acronyms, full names, functional names)
     * Complement the existing mentions
   - The total should be 5 mentions (mix of kept existing and newly generated)
   - **Avoid**:
       - Commas (`,`), parentheses.
       - ALL_CAPS or underscored terms (e.g., `ALPHA_TOCOPHEROL`).
       - Chemical names.
       - Non-English terms or foreign language mentions.
2. **Contextual Usage Examples:**
   For each of the final 5 mentions:
   - Write one clear sentence (15-30 words) with the mention in brackets in the style of a biomedical abstract.
   - Each must:
       - Include the concept in `[brackets]`.
       - Start with `example: `.
       - Be **distinct in context** (e.g., different study types, organisms, biological systems, or outcomes)
       - Mimic the tone and vocabulary typical of **PubMed biomedical research** papers

# PubMed Abstract Style Examples
- Red ripe fruits were morphologically characterized and biochemically analyzed for their content in glycoalkaloids, phenols, amino acids, and Amadori products.
- "MeHg bioaccumulated and induced significant increase of the photosynthesis efficiency, while the algal growth, oxidative stress, and chlorophyll fluorescence were unaffected.
- "Students from a midsize private university (n = 159) completed a 15-minute anonymous questionnaire, including questions on risk behaviors, sleep habits, alcohol, and caffeine consumption.

# Output Format
## Final Mention Set
1. Mention 1
2. Mention 2
...
5. Mention 5

## Usage Examples
example: "Sentence with [mention 1] in context..."
